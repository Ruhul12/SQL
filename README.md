### Manipulation

#### Column Constraints
Column constraints are the rules applied to the values of individual columns:

- **PRIMARY KEY** constraint can be used to uniquely identify the row.
- **UNIQUE** columns have a different value for every row.
- **NOT NULL** columns must have a value.
- **DEFAULT** assigns a default value for the column when no value is specified.

There can be only one PRIMARY KEY column per table and multiple UNIQUE columns.

```
CREATE TABLE student ( 
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
 name TEXT UNIQUE, 
 grade INTEGER NOT NULL,
 age INTEGER DEFAULT 10
 );
 ```
 
#### CREATE TABLE Statment

The **CREATE TABLE** statement creates a new table in a database. It allows one to specify the name of the table and the name of each column in the table.
 
```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column1 datatype,
  column2 datatype,
  column3 datatype
);
```

#### INSERT Statement
The **INSERT INTO** statement is used to add a new record (row) to a table.

It has two forms as shown:
- Insert into columns in order.
- Insert into columns by name.

```
-- Insert into columns in order:
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2);
 
-- Insert into columns by name:
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);
```

#### ALTER TABLE Statement
The **ALTER TABLE** statement is used to modify the columns of an existing table. When combined with the **ADD COLUMN** clause, it is used to add a new column.

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
```

#### DELETE Statement
The **DELETE** statement is used to delete records (rows) in a table. The **WHERE** clause specifies which record or records that should be deleted. If the **WHERE** clause is omitted, all records will be deleted.

```
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE some_column = some_value;
```

#### UPDATE Statement
The **UPDATE** statement is used to edit records (rows) in a table. It includes a **SET** clause that indicates the column to edit and a **WHERE** clause for specifying the record(s).

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE some_column = some_value;
```

### Queries

#### AND Operator
The **AND** operator allows multiple conditions to be combined. Records must match both conditions that are joined by **AND** to be included in the result set. The given query will match any car that is blue and made after 2014.

```
SELECT model 
FROM cars 
WHERE color = 'blue' 
  AND year > 2014;
```

#### % Wildcard
The **%** wildcard can be used in a **LIKE** operator pattern to match zero or more unspecified character(s). The given query will match any movie that begins with The, followed by zero or more of any characters.

```
SELECT name
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'The%';
```

#### AS Clause
Columns or tables can be aliased using the **AS** clause. This allows columns or tables to be specifically renamed in the returned result set. The given query will return a result set with the column for **name** renamed to **movie_title.**

```
SELECT name AS 'movie_title'
FROM movies;
```

#### OR Operator
The ```OR``` operator allows multiple conditions to be combined. Records matching either condition joined by the ```OR``` are included in the result set. The given query will match customers whose state is either ```'CA'``` or ```'NY'```.

```
SELECT name
FROM customers 
WHERE state = 'CA' 
   OR state = 'NY';
```   

#### SELECT Statement
The ```SELECT *``` statement returns all columns from the provided table in the result set. The given query will fetch all columns and records (rows) from the ```movies``` table.

```
SELECT *
FROM movies;
```

#### _ Wildcard
The ```_``` wildcard can be used in a ```LIKE``` operator pattern to match any single unspecified character. The given query will match any movie which begins with a single character, followed by ```ove.```

```
SELECT name
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE '_ove';
```

#### ORDER BY Clause
The ```ORDER BY``` clause can be used to sort the result set by a particular column either alphabetically or numerically. It can be ordered in two ways:

- ```DESC``` is a keyword used to sort the results in descending order.
- ```ASC``` is a keyword used to sort the results in ascending order (default).

```
SELECT *
FROM contacts
ORDER BY birth_date DESC;
```

#### LIKE Operator
The ```LIKE``` operator can be used inside of a ```WHERE``` clause to match a specified pattern. The given query will match any movie that begins with ```Star``` in its title.

```
SELECT name
FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'Star%';
```

#### DISTINCT Clause
Unique values of a column can be selected using a `DISTINCT` query. For a table `contact_details` having five rows in which the `city` column contains Chicago, Madison, Boston, Madison, and Denver, the given query would return:

- `Chicago`
- `Madison`
- `Boston`
- `Denver`

```
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM contact_details;
```
